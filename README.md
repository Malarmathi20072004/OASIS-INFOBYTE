# OASIS-INFOBYTE

I have kept the tasks completed in the intership in Data Science offered bt Oasis Infobyte.

It was definitely a privilege for me to do an intership in Oasis Infobyte.  I was able to test the skills I have learnt by applying them on projects.  The intership program was structured and designed to be easily comprehended by everyone.  I opted for the data science intership program.  There were 5 tasks in it.  Each of the tasks were so well designed, as all of those 5 tasks represented the skills needed for every Data science aspirant.  So it was amazing and interested to complete those projects.  I am so glad that I had this opporunity.  I came to know about this opportunity from Linkedin.  It is good to see how vast people are connected in the network of Oasis Infobyt encouraging everyone to do things productive like these.

TASKS GIVEN : 
Iris flower prediction
UnEmployment Analysis in India
Car price prediction
Email spam prediction
Sales prediction

IRIS FLOWER PREDICTION

This project is very important for beginners to know how exactly machine learning works.  The dimensions of the flowers are given by which we have to classify the flower into it's families [Seatosa, Versicolor, Virginical].  I used Decision Tree Classifier to predict iris flowers.

UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS IN INDIA

In this Employment Analysis,  I have tried to use various Visualization techniques to analyze and understand the data well.  Firstly,  I tired to visualize the Unemployment Rate with respect to each using barplot.  Then, I created dashboards for displaying each state unemployment rate.

CAR PRICE PREDICTION

In a Car price prediction dataset, a lot of features were given.  There were a lot of nominal data in the dataset which can't be fed to the model.  So I used a label encoder to encode thoswe features.  And then I used a linear refression model to predict the Car price using the features.

EMAIL SPAM DETECTION

It is necessary for us to be able to classify spam emails inorder to avoid a clumsy inbox.  So to train a model that will be able to classify spam emails,  The dataset had a lot of messafes and each were classified it it is spam or not.  So I used count vectorizer to encode the messages into a vector.  The I used to trained it on that data.  And finally I was able to classify spam emails with the help of the model.  When spliting and testing the model, It showed an accuracy of 98.4%

SALES PREDICTION

The dataset showed how the sales in respective to the advertisrments done in Television, Radios and Newspapers.  Analysing this will let us be able to train a model that can predict the possible sales considering the Advertisement done on the TV, Radios and Newspaper.  First, I used a scatter plot to plot each of the advertisement mediums with respect to the sales acheived to grt a clear idea on the data.  Then, I used a Linear regression model to train on the data.

CONCLUSION :

I would like to bestow my heartful thanks to Oasis infobyte for this wonderful opportunity.  I assure you that I will let many people know about this and promote this good community as much as I could.
